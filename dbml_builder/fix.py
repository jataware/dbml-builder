fix.py - The generation of the ORMs and schemas relies on two libraries 'PyDBML' and
         'O! My Models'. Both of these packages are mildly brittle so the DDL generated
         by 'PyDBML' needs to be massaged so the 'simple-ddl-parser' (the dependency of
         'O! My Models' that parses DDL) will not crash.

         The primary export of this library is `patch` which takes a string of DDL text
         and patches it so the `create_models` function won't break on the parsing step.

         Hopefully, patches will be submitted upstream so this module can be dropped.
         Upstream PRs and fixes will also be provided in the comment below.
